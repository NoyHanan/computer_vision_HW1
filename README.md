*   A good dataset is a key for successful model training.

*   This assignment guides you how to create two labeled datasets, which could later be used for
supervised learning.

## Overview

Image augmentations are used to increase the variability and robustness of a dataset

## Goals - Create a larger dataset from a smaller one:

1.

  *   The original MNIST dataset includes images of single digits, in ten classes.
  *   Your goal is to create a new three-digit image dataset, with 101 classes, based on the original MNIST dataset.
2.

  *   Create a dataset of shape images with three classes: (Triangle, Rectangle and Circle/Elipse)
